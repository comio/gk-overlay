10. ASSIGNMENT

You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer this EULA, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of GitKraken, which may be withheld in GitKraken’s sole discretion, except as part of the sale or other transfer of any Server on which the Software came pre-loaded, provided that you retain no copies of the Software and the transferee agrees in writing to honor the terms and conditions of this EULA in all respects. In the case of any such transfer, GitKraken shall continue to own all right, title and interest in and to any intellectual property embodied in the Software. Any attempt by you to assign or otherwise transfer your right and obligations under this EULA in violation of the provisions of this Section 10 shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this EULA will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.


11. PRIVACY POLICY

GitKraken collects information about its users to measure and analyze how its users interact with its products, such as usage patterns and characteristics of its user base, and for other business purposes. GitKraken collects such information in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference and may be updated from time to time at GitKraken’s sole discretion. Your continued use of the Software following any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.


12. CLASS ACTION WAIVER; ARBITRATION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER

12.1 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY.

12.2 Arbitration Agreement.

To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you and the Company each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this EULA or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by final and binding, individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (or Commercial Arbitration Rules, if applicable) then in effect. The arbitration shall take place in Phoenix, Arizona, and shall be governed by Arizona law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section above. This Section does not preclude either party from bringing a claim in court that may not be subject to arbitration under applicable law.

12.3 Jury Trial Waiver. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS EULA OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, BOTH PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO ALL MATTERS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AND ENCOMPASSES ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.


13. GENERAL PROVISIONS

No term or provision hereof will be considered waived by GitKraken, and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent is in writing signed by GitKraken.
